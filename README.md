# ArchSilver AS-47 Alice-Inspired 45% Gasket-Mounted Hand-wired Keyboard

**Current status - First 3D model is incomplete, and is still a work in progress.**

## Project Objectives
- Fix inconsistent spacing of the Alice-inspired layout.
- Resolve all the issues with the Laetitia LT-47 keyboard prototype, which was an earlier project.
- Make the keyboard more compact with the use of Kailh low-profile switches and CFX keycaps by Chosfox.
- Learn ZMK

## Planned Features
- Nice! Nano controller
- Nice! View screen at the top of the keyboard face.
- Bluetooth.
- 1100mah Lipo Battery
- ON/OFF switch on the right hand-side of keyboard.
- Window showing off the hand-wiring.
- Indents for 8mm feet.
- Gasket-mount using D65 gaskets from KBDFans.
- A keylayout that is "brick-laid" by hand to resemble brick arches with 47 keys total. (Hence the name Arch-Silver)
- Doubling down on the silver theme by using Kailh Low-profile silver switches.

_47 is the elemental number of Silver._

## 3D-printed Gasket Mount Keyboard CAD process (Janky Boolean process that takes forever)
**IMPORTANT - Always layout the inside first as this will determine how big the case will be.**
**IMPORTANT - Always allow for 0.2-0.4mm of tolerance. **
- Define key layout.
- Create an outline for the key layout, this will be where the hole/s in the top case will be for where the keys will go.
- Lay down the gaskets in desired positons.
- Plan where the screws and attachment nuts will go.
- Add pillars around the screw holes. This will be for the bottom case.
- Add pillars around the attachment nuts. This will be for the top case.
- Create the Keyboard Plate.
- Measure out outer case dimensions, making sure that all the walls are at least 0.8mm. (I am currently at this stage.)
- Create top and bottom case.
- ???
- PROFIT!!!
